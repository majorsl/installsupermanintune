# installsupermanintune
Script to install S.U.P.E.R.M.A.N. to host Macs via Intune.

Note: this is *not* my work! It is modified for Intune by Boris Dreyer. Try as I might, I cannot find the original source.  It was posted on the MacAdmins slack channel for #super (https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/C03LKQ8EN2C) and I happened to be searching for this very thing.  Right place at the right time.

If someone knows the orginal location, let me know and I'll link to it here and remove the source!
